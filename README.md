## Open Tasks

1. Unfinished minor responsiveness bugs. I would need around half a day to make those changes and make it fully responsive and stable.

2. As I had not enough time, I didn't manage to test the app. After some reading about unit testing, I think I would need one working day to build basic and important unit tests for the app.

3. I would need one day more to build the UI as I consider it to be aesthetic stable and serve the best UI/UX practises along with the use of both Bootstrap and Angular Material. Nevertheless, I build the app with some basic Angular Material components.
